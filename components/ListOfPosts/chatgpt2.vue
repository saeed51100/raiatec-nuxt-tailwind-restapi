To convert the given PHP WordPress code to Nuxt 3 using the <script setup lang="ts"> syntax (Composition API), we'll need to use JavaScript and the Vue.js framework. Nuxt 3 doesn't exist yet as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, but we can use Nuxt 2 with the Composition API instead. Keep in mind that Nuxt 3 may have new features and changes, but this example should be a good starting point.

    First, install the required packages by running:
    bash
Copy code
npm install @nuxtjs/composition-api
Next, create a new Nuxt 2 project or use an existing one.

    Create a new component file, for example, "MyComponent.vue":

html
Copy code
<template>
<div>
    <ul v-if="posts.length">
    <li
        v-for="post in posts"
  :key="post.id"
style="margin-top: 5px; list-style-type: none;"
    >
    <a
:href="post.permalink"
:class="{ 'list-group': post.id === currentId && isSingle }"
    >
    {{ post.title }}
</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { reactive, ref, onMounted } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api';

const posts = reactive([]);
const currentId = ref(0);
const isSingle = ref(false);

onMounted(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-wordpress-api-url.com/posts');
    const data = await response.json();
    posts.value = data.posts;
  }
  fetchData();
});
</script>
In the above code, we're using the Composition API's reactive, ref, and onMounted functions to fetch data from the WordPress API and display the list of posts. Replace 'https://your-wordpress-api-url.com/posts' with the actual URL to your WordPress API endpoint that returns posts in JSON format.

Add the component to a page or layout where you want to display the list of posts:
html
Copy code
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>My WordPress Posts</h1>
    <MyComponent :current-id="currentId" :is-single="isSingle" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api';
import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent.vue';

const currentId = ref(0);
const isSingle = ref(false);
</script>
In this code, we're using the Composition API's ref to store the currentId and isSingle values, which will be passed to the MyComponent.

If you want to use the category information as well, you can modify the component accordingly by adding the category data to the fetched posts and use it for rendering.
Please note that this is a basic example and may need further adjustments based on your specific WordPress setup and requirements. Also, the Nuxt 3 version might be different, but the core concepts of using the Composition API to fetch data and manage state will likely remain the same.
